Challenge Description:
You will write code to complete a web service that allows students to submit their suggestions/feedback. The HTML page feedback.html will contain a form that submits to comments.php. After submission, comments.php will do some checks to validate the information submitted, and it will output a web page that either confirms the submission or informs the user to try submitting again.

Task 1: Creating a Form
This task involves creating an HTML from (such as feedback.html) that POSTs its submitted data to a PHP program on a server. The form should at least has a set of radio/checkbox button, 2 text input fields, 1 comment input field, and 1 - 2 buttons.

Task 2: Displaying Input Data
In this task, you will write the PHP page that will handle the submitted form data. Tell your feedback.html to POST data to a comments PHP page (such as comments.php). The comments.php page will receive the parameters from feedback.html and will output an HTML confirmation page.

Task 3: Save the Form Data
Modify your comments.php page to save the submitted data to the file comments.txt. Also change your page's output to show the complete contents of the file comments.txt to the user.

Task 4: Basic Data Validation
Update your comments.php file to verify that the user did not leave any fields blank when submitting the form. You can check whether a particular parameter has been passed using the PHP function isset. If the user has not filled in every field, show an error message instead of displaying their submitted data.
